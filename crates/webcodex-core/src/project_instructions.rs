//! Project instructions auto-load.
//!
//! When a session is started for a project, WebCodex best-effort loads
//! project-local instruction files (e.g. `AGENTS.md`) so GPT Action / MCP /
//! Codex / GLM callers see project-local development rules at session start.
//!
//! These files are project-local guidance only; they never override system,
//! platform, or WebCodex safety policy. Root sources come from a fixed whitelist;
//! coding startup may additionally discover bounded, Git-tracked nested
//! AGENTS.md/agents.md sources. Arbitrary caller-supplied paths and secrets are never read. Read
//! failures never cause startup itself to fail. `start_session` retains its
//! first-match behavior; coding startup observes every fixed candidate and
//! marks an incomplete scan unavailable so a transient read failure cannot be
//! mistaken for a source deletion.
