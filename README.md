# WebCodex

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

**WebCodex lets ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI agents work directly with code and developer tools on your own machines.**

Ask your assistant to inspect a repository, modify code, run tests, use Git, or investigate a failure. Your repository stays on the machine where it already lives; you do not need to move the project into a hosted workspace just to use an AI coding agent.

## Start using WebCodex

### Everyday development: full WebCodex (recommended)

If you want ChatGPT to keep using your real development environment, start with a **regular Server + Runner**. This is the full development experience: durable access to multiple projects plus project exploration, editing, Git, commands, tests, long-running work, and code navigation. Public HTTPS, Cloudflare Tunnel, and OpenAI Secure MCP Tunnel are only ways for ChatGPT to reach the Server; they do not switch you into a different restricted experience.

For Windows or macOS, the recommended first path is **WebCodex Desktop + the official OpenAI Secure Tunnel**. Follow the [Desktop installation guide](docs/desktop-install.md). For CLI, an existing Server, self-hosting, or advanced setup, use the [Full Setup guide](docs/PERSONAL_SETUP.md).

### Just trying it for a few minutes: temporary share

To quickly see whether WebCodex fits your workflow, run this inside one repository:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/repository
npx --yes @yyjeqhc/webcodex share
```

`share` starts a temporary, single-project instance of the ordinary WebCodex Adaptive Runtime and prints the ChatGPT connection values. Its temporary Project Credential limits access to that ProjectGrant; the endpoint and credential stop working when the command exits. It is intended for trials and short-lived sharing, not as the default full daily setup. See the [Quick Trial](docs/QUICK_START.md) for the exact steps.

## What can it do?

- **Understand and edit code** — read, search, inspect, and make guarded changes inside configured projects.
- **Use the real toolchain** — run commands, tests, formatters, compilers, and project-specific tooling on the machine that owns the repository.
- **Work with Git** — inspect status and diffs while keeping repository operations visible and reviewable.
- **Handle long-running work** — keep jobs observable instead of requiring one model turn to stay open indefinitely.
- **Support human review** — use the [Runtime Console](docs/runtime-console.md), Workflow Session evidence, Jobs, and Git/diff review without a separate task/result acceptance subsystem.

## Why WebCodex?

- **Your code stays on your machine.** The repository does not need to be copied into the chat service.
- **The agent gets a real development environment.** It can use the same files, Git checkout, compilers, tests, and tools you already use.
- **Work survives beyond a single request.** Long-running execution and evidence remain observable through WebCodex.
- **Start temporary or run it long-term.** Use one-command sharing for a quick session, or connect machines to a self-hosted Server for a durable setup.

## Fork enhancements: Zero-Quota Native-like Runtime

This fork also maintains an enhanced branch, [`vue-lsp-native-main`](https://github.com/zhengweijun18/webcodex/tree/vue-lsp-native-main), focused on making ChatGPT + WebCodex behave more like a reliable local coding agent while keeping **Native Codex model usage at zero**.

Current validated baseline: `3082590b87de6f023d775c98f8a082df6b4168c4`.

Key additions on that branch include:

- **Zero-Quota Native Context** — reuse observable Codex Runtime context such as Skills, scoped project instructions, Hooks, and Knowledge without starting a Native Codex model turn or silently falling back to a Codex agent.
- **Automatic project context** — `AGENTS.md`, nested scoped instructions, available Skills, Knowledge, runtime context, and workflow state can be projected automatically before the agent starts work.
- **Pathless Skill / Knowledge contracts** — the model works with Skill names, opaque ids, and semantic Knowledge keys instead of depending on developer-machine absolute paths.
- **Durable Jobs and Workflow recovery** — long builds/tests survive beyond one chat turn, and Workflow Sessions retain validation/context continuity across reconnects and restarts.
- **Safer real-world effects** — uncertain mutations fail closed instead of being silently replayed; retries keep the original deadline and do not silently retarget another Runner.
- **Structured validation** — terminal process state and exit codes are authoritative, preventing successful silent commands such as `cargo fmt --check` from being recorded as unresolved failures.
- **Native Vue LSP** — Vue SFC navigation, references, diagnostics, symbols, and a pinned Vue/TypeScript toolchain work through WebCodex's native LSP surface.
- **One-shot Desktop adoption** — candidate verification, verified backup, exact App-bundle shutdown, single relaunch, health check, Last Known Good promotion, and automatic rollback if the new Desktop does not become healthy.
- **Self-maintaining fork** — behavioral patch-retirement checks determine whether upstream has truly replaced a local capability before that patch can be removed.
- **Doctor + reproducible provenance** — source, installed Desktop, running Server/Runner, rollback state, toolchain, Zero-Quota evidence, and build provenance can be checked mechanically.

This does **not** claim to copy OpenAI's private Codex Host, model reasoning/planning, model-side tool-selection intelligence, or the Native Codex TUI. The target is observable, testable runtime behavior only.

A ready-to-share macOS Intel handoff package for the validated baseline is available here:

## Platforms

- **Linux x64/arm64** — local `share`, Server, and Runner workflows.
- **macOS x64/arm64** — Desktop local Server + Runner, OpenAI Secure Tunnel, local `share`, and standalone Runner workflows.
- **Windows x64** — Desktop local Server + Runner with the official OpenAI Secure Tunnel, plus CLI + Runner, local foreground Server, and explicit `webcodex share --tunnel cloudflare|openai|none`.
- **Windows arm64** — CLI + Runner, local foreground Server, and `share`; managed OpenAI `tunnel-client` is supported. The pinned Cloudflare release has no official Windows ARM64 artifact, so Cloudflare requires a trusted explicit/PATH `cloudflared`. The Desktop installer is currently Windows x64 only. WebCodex-managed Windows Server services remain unsupported outside Desktop's owned foreground runtime.

Windows and long-lived deployments are covered in [Deployment](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) and [MCP](docs/MCP.md).

## Existing Servers and advanced setup

If someone already provides the WebCodex Server and connection credential, use that existing Server and follow the [Full Setup guide](docs/PERSONAL_SETUP.md). For a normal Windows/macOS personal installation, use the [Desktop guide](docs/desktop-install.md). Use [Deployment](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) only for production hosting, multiple users, systemd/Docker, OAuth, proxies, and private CAs.

Those are follow-up operating concerns, not concepts a first-time user should have to learn before WebCodex works.

## Security

WebCodex can read and modify files and execute commands inside configured project boundaries. Use version control, keep credentials out of prompts/logs/Git, and register only project roots the assistant should access. Read [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the complete model.

## Build from source

```bash
cargo build --release --workspace --bins
export PATH="$PWD/target/release:$PATH"
```
