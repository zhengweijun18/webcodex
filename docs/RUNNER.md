# Runner

The Runner is the component that executes the actual work. The executable is
`webcodex-runner`; the CLI namespace that manages it is `webcodex runner ...`.
`webcodex` and `webcodex-runner` are separate executables. Operator lifecycle
commands use the `runner` namespace; historical `agent` terminology remains only
where it is part of a compatibility-facing token, storage, identity, project-id,
or wire contract. This page explains what the Runner does, how it connects, how it
registers projects, how to operate it as a service, and its main runtime
concepts.

For installation and service setup, see [Deployment](DEPLOYMENT.md). For the
commands that manage the Runner, see [CLI](CLI.md#runner-lifecycle).

## What the Runner does

The Runner runs on the machine that owns the repositories. It connects out to
a WebCodex Server, registers the projects it is allowed to serve, and executes
bounded operations — file reads and edits, Git inspection, structured
validation, shell commands, and long-running Jobs — inside those project
boundaries.

The Runner is the trust boundary closest to your repository. Configure it with
narrow allowed roots and explicit shell profiles rather than broad interactive
shell state.

## Core terms

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Server** | Authenticates callers, stores shared runtime state, and routes work. |
| **CLI** | The `webcodex` operator/developer command. |
| **Runner** | The `webcodex-runner` process that executes repository work. |
| **profile** | A named local Runner/client configuration. |
| **client_id** | Stable logical name for one Runner/device. |
| **Project** | A repository/workspace registered by that Runner. |

Some compatibility-facing values still use the historical word `agent`, including the `wc_agent_*` Runner-token prefix and `agent:<client_id>:<project_id>` runtime Project address. They do not refer to WebCodex's separate Durable Agent domain, and ordinary users do not need the process-level lease identifiers behind Runner recovery.

### Runner config filename compatibility

`runner.toml` is the canonical config filename. A legacy directory containing only `agent.toml` remains readable for compatibility; if both names exist in the same config directory WebCodex fails closed and asks the operator to resolve the ambiguity. `WEBCODEX_RUNNER_CONFIG` is the current path override; the old `WEBCODEX_AGENT_CONFIG` remains a compatibility alias.

## Connecting to the Server

The Runner connects out to the Server using one of four transports, selected by
the `transport` setting in `runner.toml`:

| Transport | Config value | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Auto | `auto` | Recommended for production when `[quic]` is configured: QUIC first, then WebSocket, then polling. |
| QUIC | `quic` | Strict QUIC only. Separate UDP listener on the Server. |
| WebSocket | `websocket` | Stable fallback for simple deployments without UDP. |
| Polling | `polling` | Last-resort fallback for constrained networks. |

The Runner authenticates with its Runner token (compatibility prefix `wc_agent_*`) or, in hosted shared-key mode, the matching shared key. This credential is for Runner transport only; it is not an MCP, REST, or GPT Actions credential.

WebSocket and polling authenticate the first-party Runner with
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`; query-string Runner credentials are not
accepted. QUIC keeps its credential in the transport-specific v1 first-register
frame while the shared Runner envelope remains credential-free.

### Server/Runner compatibility

When upgrading an older installation across the 0.4 boundary, upgrade the first-party Server and Runner together. Within `0.4.x`, first-party releases keep a stable protocol baseline and add new optional capabilities explicitly; when an older compatible Runner lacks one of those capabilities, that feature fails closed instead of being guessed or emulated.

The exact protocol-generation field names, baseline capability list, registration grammar, and compatibility-test matrix are maintainer/wire-contract details and are intentionally omitted from this operations guide.

If you use QUIC, keep Server and Runner QUIC settings compatible. `[quic].keepalive_interval_secs` defaults to 20 seconds and accepts `1..=25`; invalid values are rejected rather than silently clamped.

## Registering projects

Projects live on the Runner machine. The Runner registers allowed directories
with the Server; the Server does not scan the filesystem and does not invent
project paths.

Each registered project is a one-file-per-project TOML file in the Runner's
`project_registry_dir` (default `project-registry`). The format:

```toml
id = "webcodex"
path = "/srv/webcodex/projects/webcodex"
name = "WebCodex"
kind = "repo"
allow_patch = true
```

`id` and `path` are the important fields; `kind` is optional descriptive metadata.
The registry directory is storage for Project records, not a workspace root.

New configurations use `project-registry/` and `project_registry_dir`. A legacy
installation that has only `projects.d/` / `projects_dir` remains readable. If
both old and new locations/fields are configured, WebCodex fails closed instead
of merging or guessing precedence. Use `--project-registry-dir` in new CLI
commands.

Runtime project ids take the shape `agent:<client_id>:<project_id>`, for example `agent:workstation:my-repo`. ToolRuntime resolves these ids through the caller-visible Runner registry; ordinary users usually do not type them.

### Allowed roots

`allowed_roots` in the Runner policy controls where projects may be registered
or created:

- Missing or empty `allowed_roots` defaults to `$HOME`.
- An explicit `allowed_roots` overrides that default.
- Use explicit roots to narrow a Runner to one workspace tree, for example:

```toml
[policy]
allow_cwd_anywhere = false
allowed_roots = ["/root/git"]
```

### Registering projects at runtime

The runtime tools `register_project` and `create_project` let a client register
an existing directory or create a new one on an online Runner, subject to the
Runner's `allowed_roots` policy.

## Skill sources

`skill_list` presents one catalog while preserving three distinct ownership and
lifecycle models:

| Source | Location / owner | Trust | Version semantics |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Project Skills | `<project>/.agents/skills/<package>/SKILL.md` | `project_content` | Live project content; no package revision. |
| Configured live Runner Skill roots | Operator-selected absolute directories on the Runner host | `operator_configured_guidance` | Live filesystem content that WebCodex does not modify; supported scripts may execute through `run_skill_resource`; no install, activation, rollback, or package revision. |
| Managed Runner Skill Store | Runner state under `runner-skills-v1` | `operator_installed_guidance` | Immutable package revisions with install, activation, removal, and rollback-oriented Store semantics. |

Configured live roots are optional and have no implicit defaults. Each configured
root contains normal Agent Skill packages directly:

```toml
[skills]
roots = [
    "/home/alice/.codex/skills",
    "/home/alice/.agents/skills",
    "/opt/company/agent-skills",
]
```

On Windows, use absolute local paths; TOML literal strings are convenient for
backslashes:

```toml
[skills]
roots = [
    'C:\Users\alice\.codex\skills',
    'C:\Users\alice\.agents\skills',
]
```

A root has the form `<root>/<package>/SKILL.md`, with optional package resources
such as `references/` and `scripts/`. These directories are read directly by the
Runner. WebCodex does not modify files in configured roots or copy them into the
managed Store; `skill_install`, `skill_activate`, and `skill_remove_revision`
continue to mutate only that Store. This non-mutating behavior does not make the
source non-executable: `run_skill_resource` may execute supported `scripts/*.py`
or `scripts/*.sh` from an operator-configured trusted Skill.

The configured paths belong to the **Runner host**, even when the Server is on a
different machine, and selecting them is an explicit operator trust decision for
the narrow Skill runtime. They are not added to `[policy].allowed_roots`, do not
grant ordinary Project file/shell/process tools access to those directories, and
native root paths are not projected through the model-facing Skill catalog. Skill
reads and `run_skill_resource` accept only an opaque `skill_id` plus a
package-relative resource path; the Runner resolves the root from its trusted
configuration and rejects traversal or link escapes.

Skill files remain live: editing `SKILL.md` or a resource is visible to the next
discovery/read without any reload. For configured Skills,
`expected_definition_revision` fences the `SKILL.md` definition, not the resource
bytes: `run_skill_resource` re-reads the selected script at execution and returns
`skill_sha256` for the actual bytes executed. Managed installed Skills additionally
use `expected_package_revision` to fence the immutable package. Changing the
configured `roots` list is a hot-reloadable Runner configuration change: edit
`runner.toml`, run `runner_config_check`, then `runner_config_reload` with the
current generation. No Runner process restart is required.

## Runner-level configured instructions

A Runner can project the same coding guidance into every Project bootstrap on that
Runner. v1 is configured manually in the Runner's `runner.toml`; Desktop file
selection/upload UI is intentionally deferred.

```toml
[instructions]
files = [
    "/home/alice/.codex/AGENTS.md",
]
```

On macOS use the equivalent Runner-local absolute path such as
`/Users/alice/.codex/AGENTS.md`. On Windows, TOML literal strings avoid escaping
backslashes:

```toml
[instructions]
files = [
    'C:\Users\alice\.codex\AGENTS.md',
]
```

There is no implicit `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` discovery. Each configured path is
absolute and Runner-local. At coding startup, Runner-configured sources are
projected first in deterministic config order, followed by the existing
project-local candidates (`AGENTS.md`, `agents.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
`.codex/AGENTS.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`). Both classes are model
guidance only; neither changes execution authority.

Configured instruction files are read by a narrow Runner-owned instruction
runtime. Their parent directories are **not** added to `[policy].allowed_roots`,
ordinary Project file/shell/process tools do not gain access to them, and native
absolute paths are not projected to the model. Model-facing sources use sanitized
logical identities instead.

Configured sources must be ordinary UTF-8 files, at most 1 MiB each. The file and
its parent components must not be symbolic links or Windows reparse points
(including directory junctions); configure the resolved physical path instead.
Parent traversal is handle-relative on Unix and preserves search-only directory
semantics where the platform exposes them. On Windows, the parent path is
acquired with a native no-reparse open and the leaf is opened relative to that
pinned parent handle; the parent identity is rechecked before accepting the
observation, so a concurrent parent replacement cannot retarget the configured
read. Non-Unix/non-Windows targets fail closed instead of falling back to a
path-based open. Windows verbatim disk/UNC paths remain accepted, but remote filesystems
depend on their server-side reparse and handle semantics and should not be
treated as providing stronger guarantees than the remote server implements.
The reader checks the opened file handle and enforces the byte bound during
reading, not only through a prior metadata check. Unreadable, redirected, oversized, or invalid-UTF-8
sources make the instruction scan incomplete without exposing their native paths
or failing the entire Project bootstrap.

Changing `[instructions].files` is hot-reloadable: edit `runner.toml`, run
`runner_config_check`, then `runner_config_reload` with the current generation.
No Runner restart is required. The files themselves remain live: editing a
configured `AGENTS.md` is visible to the next `work_on_project`/new Project
bootstrap without any config reload. Each Project bootstrap observes the current
Runner-global instructions independently; v1 does not retain or suppress them
across Projects. Truncated Runner-global sources stay bounded and do not create a
generic arbitrary-file `read_more` authority.


An empty configured file or a missing leaf beneath verified ordinary parent
directories confirms removal. A missing, redirected, or unreadable parent leaves
the Runner scope unavailable, as do other read failures. Removing an entry from
`instructions.files` remains an explicit revocation after config reload.
An explicit Session resume refreshes Runner and
Project scopes independently, retaining an unavailable scope's last-known rules
only in memory. A newly observed Runner instance or config generation cannot
inherit the previous global rules. Within one instance, a higher known config
generation wins regardless of request start order; an unknown generation cannot
replace a known generation. Instance replacement uses live-instance verification
order, so a late retired-instance observation cannot restore old guidance.
Within one instance/generation, request observation order breaks ties. Project
reads have their own start-order fence, independent of Runner availability;
late Project observations retain newer local rules and report an incomplete
scan. Retention is scope-wide, not per-file within an incomplete scope.
Instruction bodies and observation fences are not persisted.

Project-local text reserves its share of the 32 Ki-character snapshot before
global text is shortened; presentation remains global-before-project. Session
retention selects scopes before applying this shared budget. An independently
bounded global source copy (at most 32 Ki characters) stays only in Session
memory, so retaining a short Project scope or later shrinking it can recover
global text hidden by an earlier aggregate budget. This source copy and all
observation fences are omitted from public snapshots and summaries. Runner
sources never receive a Project `read_file` continuation, including during final
startup byte-budget reduction. `include_project_instructions=false` suppresses
bodies without skipping observation or change detection. An explicit
`project.instructions` context request observes current Runner and Project
sources together, without reusing Session-retained bodies. The instruction
projection fits the remaining 20 KiB shared sidecar envelope by dropping derived
headings before shortening text, preserving source identities and Project rules
instead of discarding the entire material solely because global sources were added.

## Local MCP providers

The Runner can directly host persistent stdio MCP providers for WebCodex's built-in MCP gateway:

```toml
[mcp]
request_timeout_secs = 30

[[mcp.providers]]
id = "github"
name = "GitHub"
executable = "/absolute/path/to/github-mcp-server"
args = []
cwd = "/absolute/provider/workdir"
env_from_env = { GITHUB_TOKEN = "GITHUB_TOKEN", PATH = "PATH", HOME = "HOME" }
timeout_secs = 30
```

`executable` and optional `cwd` must be absolute host-local operator configuration. Invalid paths fail closed. `[mcp]` participates in the normal generation-fenced Runner config reload transaction: unchanged providers keep their exact provider identity and live connection, changed providers receive a fresh provider identity, and added/removed providers update routing without restarting the Runner. Old exact provider identities fail closed and are never retargeted.

Provider processes do not inherit the Runner environment wholesale. `env_from_env` copies only explicitly named variables, and WebCodex's own sensitive transport/account credential variables cannot be mapped. A missing configured source variable fails before provider start. On Windows, the Runner additionally supplies only the non-secret `SYSTEMROOT` OS bootstrap after clearing the environment, unless that destination is explicitly mapped; `PATH`, user-profile state, proxies, and credentials are still not inherited.

Mapping a credential delegates that credential to the configured provider process. The provider can use it according to its own implementation and can choose to return derived or raw values through normal tool results; WebCodex does not attempt to redact arbitrary provider output. Treat configured providers as credential recipients, use least-privilege provider credentials, and remember that any caller authorized for `mcp:local` can exercise the provider capabilities that those credentials enable.

A provider connection starts on first real interaction and is reused while healthy. A fatal stdio/protocol failure retires only that connection; WebCodex never replays the failed request. A later explicit request may start a fresh connection under the same logical provider identity, and an effectful `tools/call` re-lists and checks the bound tool schema before dispatch. The Server sees the logical provider `id`/`name`, not its executable path, environment values, PID, stderr, or Runner credential. `mcp_tool(action=list)` reports only routing resolvability. `mcp_tool(action=status, server=...)` is a passive Runner-side lifecycle observation that never starts, initializes, or pings a provider; it reports only `never_started`, `healthy`, `connection_retired`, or `busy`. Here `healthy` means the retained connection's child process is still running, not that an end-to-end MCP health probe was performed. `list(server=...)` and `describe` interact with the provider.

### Provider-side gateway V1 compatibility

The built-in Runner-to-provider gateway is intentionally a bounded stdio tool subset, not a transparent bridge to every MCP feature:

- provider-side tool behavior is based on MCP `2025-06-18`;
- `tools/list` and `tools/call` are supported;
- callbacks, list pagination, media/resources, and end-to-end progress forwarding are not supported;
- text tool results and bounded `structuredContent` are supported.

Unsupported protocol/content shapes fail closed instead of being silently translated.

## Shell profiles

Ordinary project shell/process execution defaults to `[shell] environment_mode =
"inherit"`: PATH, HOME/USERPROFILE and toolchain variables come from the process
that started the Runner. WebCodex transport/account credentials are filtered.
Shell `env` overrides inherited values; profile `env` overrides shell `env`.
Profiles cache this environment per project/config generation. An explicit
`init_script` can modify the snapshot; no startup script runs otherwise.

Set `environment_mode = "isolated"` for a minimal environment: `/usr/bin:/bin` on
Unix, or SystemRoot and its System32 PATH on Windows, plus configured env and
path_prepend. This is environment isolation, not a filesystem sandbox.
WebCodex does not automatically source `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile`.
Configured MCP credential delegation remains explicit; this setting does not
expand its `env_from_env` allowlist. Native Plugins continue to use the existing
filtered shell/profile environment and native-only executable contract.

Windows `run_process` and `run_detached_process` accept `.cmd`/`.bat` shims through
Runner-owned `cmd.exe /d /s /v:off /c` conversion. Each argument is quoted; spaces,
empty arguments, `&`, `|`, and parentheses are supported. Quotes, `%`, `!`, `^`,
control characters and trailing backslashes are rejected before startup. The
command is bounded to 8000 UTF-16 units. Batch shims require a local drive cwd;
UNC cwd is rejected before spawn because cmd.exe cannot preserve it. Use a native runtime executable when
arguments fall outside this contract. Batch scripts remain responsible for how
they handle their own arguments (for example, forwarding with `%*`). Process
ownership, stdin, cwd, timeout, cancellation and detached reconciliation are
unchanged; a rejected argument never starts a Job payload.

Structured exact reads can inspect `node_modules` and `target`; recursive
search/listing skip those trees. Structured edits still reject generated trees.
Credentials, `.env*`, Runner configuration and `.git` control data remain protected
for both reads and writes.

Example Rust/Cargo profile in `runner.toml`:

```toml
[shell]
default_profile = "rust"

[shell.profiles.rust]
program = "sh"
args = ["-c"]

[shell.profiles.rust.env]
PATH = "/root/.cargo/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"
CARGO_HOME = "/root/.cargo"
RUSTUP_HOME = "/root/.rustup"
```

Example Python venv profile:

```toml
[shell.profiles.py-venv]
program = "bash"
args = ["-lc"]
init_script = '''
source .venv/bin/activate
'''
```

The `init_script` is project-relative: it is resolved from the project root,
so each project activates its own venv. A project can pin a profile:

```toml
id = "paper-exp"
path = "/root/git/paper-exp"
shell_profile = "conda-ml"
```

Resolution order: `project.shell_profile`, then `shell.default_profile`, then
the plain shell config (no snapshot).

`open_session_shell` is the separate long-lived shell path. On Unix it keeps a
real `sh`/`bash` process; on Windows the local path keeps the configured
`powershell.exe`/`pwsh.exe`-compatible process and reuses the same profile/env
selection. Windows PowerShell shell/profile args must retain their normal final
`-Command` flag in configuration; the persistent transport replaces that
one-shot payload mode internally with its private bootstrap. Named SSH resources
support `run_shell`/`run_job` on Unix and Windows through the separate `ssh_shell`
capability. Persistent SSH requires `persistent_shell` + `ssh_persistent_shell`:
Unix may reuse a Runner-local OpenSSH mux, while Windows owns one direct long-lived
`ssh.exe` channel. PTY/ConPTY terminal emulation is not implied.

Security notes for profiles:

- Never put tokens in `init_script`, and never `echo` secrets into it — the
  script's stdout is parsed as part of the snapshot.
- Status and runtime APIs expose only sanitized profile metadata (name,
  `has_init_script`, env key count, program, dialect) — never `init_script`
  bodies or environment values.
- Profiles run with a cleared environment plus an explicit allowlist; declare
  the env they need.

### Typed `run_script` languages

`run_script` accepts `sh`, `bash`, `powershell`, `javascript`, and `typescript`.
JavaScript and TypeScript are external Node.js execution on the Runner. WebCodex
resolves `node` from the prepared shell/profile PATH (or uses the configured
shell/profile program when it is `node`/`node.exe`). JavaScript bodies are
written to Runner-owned `.mjs` files and launched as
`node <temporary.mjs> <args...>` with native argv. `.mjs` fixes ESM semantics
independently of project `package.json` or temporary-directory metadata.

TypeScript is deliberately a typed-script runtime, not a project compiler. The
Runner writes the body to a Runner-owned `.mts` file, so the entry module is
always ESM, and uses Node's native erasable type stripping. Node.js 22.6.0 is
the minimum supported runtime. Before creating or starting the user script, the
Runner performs one bounded `node --version` capability probe. Node 22.6 through
22.17 and Node 23.0 through 23.5 receive the Runner-owned
`--experimental-strip-types` prefix; Node 22.18+, 23.6+, and later supported
lines use the default native stripping behavior without that flag. A missing
Node, an unrecognizable version, or Node older than 22.6 is reported as
`not_started` / `interpreter_unavailable`, and the user script is never launched.
If Node accepts the version probe but the eventual script process rejects its
runtime semantics, the ordinary started-process lifecycle remains authoritative.

The TypeScript contract covers syntax that Node can erase, including type
annotations, interfaces/type aliases, generics, and ordinary JavaScript features
such as async/await, ESM, and Node built-ins. WebCodex does not type-check, invoke
`tsc`, consume `tsconfig.json` as a build configuration, implement path aliases,
or promise transform-required TypeScript syntax such as enums, parameter
properties, runtime namespaces, or import aliases. WebCodex also does not use
`--experimental-transform-types`: that flag is not part of the stable runtime
contract. On older Node versions that still mark type stripping experimental,
Node's own `ExperimentalWarning` may appear on stderr. WebCodex does not suppress
or filter that warning because doing so could also hide warnings emitted by the
user script.

For rolling upgrades, JavaScript requires the additive
`structured_script_javascript` capability and TypeScript independently requires
`structured_script_typescript`. These bits mean the running Runner binary
understands the corresponding typed-script wire semantics; they do not assert
that a compatible Node installation is present. Script args remain literal
native argv values, stdin remains independent, and both languages use the same
resolved project cwd, timeout/cancellation, Runner policy, and Job lifecycle as
other typed scripts.

WebCodex does not install or bootstrap npm dependencies, inject `node_modules`
or `NODE_PATH`, select a package manager, or fall back to Bun, Deno, `tsx`,
`npx`, or another runtime. Because the `.mjs`/`.mts` entry lives in a Runner-owned
temporary directory, relative ESM imports resolve from that temporary module,
not from the project cwd; use Node built-ins or explicit project paths/file URLs
when importing project code.

## Jobs and concurrency

A Job is a long-running command or validation that continues after the
initiating call returns. Jobs have a stable `job_id`, bounded stdout/stderr
tails, and can be stopped. Structured execution (`run_process`,
`run_script`) and validation Jobs hand off a single execution to a Job when it
outlives the synchronous grace period; the same process continues — it is never
restarted.

The Runner executes up to `max_concurrent_jobs` Jobs at once (default 4, valid
range 1..64). Values outside that range are rejected as configuration errors.
This is an operational tuning control, not a security boundary, and requires a
Runner restart to change:

```toml
max_concurrent_jobs = 4
```

When all slots are occupied, an accepted Job remains the same queryable Job
with the same `job_id` and reports `agent_queued`.

## Transports in more detail

### Server requirements for QUIC

Enable the QUIC listener on the Server and open the chosen UDP port:

```sh
WEBCODEX_QUIC_ENABLED=true
WEBCODEX_QUIC_LISTEN=0.0.0.0:8443
WEBCODEX_QUIC_CERT=/etc/letsencrypt/live/<host>/fullchain.pem
WEBCODEX_QUIC_KEY=/etc/letsencrypt/live/<host>/privkey.pem
WEBCODEX_QUIC_ALPN=webcodex-runner/1
```

The certificate SAN must match the `server_name` configured on the Runner.
`auto` tries QUIC first when `[quic]` is present, then WebSocket, then polling.

`[quic].keepalive_interval_secs` controls Quinn's transport-level UDP/QUIC
keepalive. It defaults to 20 seconds and accepts 1 through 25 seconds; values
outside that range are rejected rather than clamped. This is separate from
WebCodex application `Ping`/`Pong` liveness, which remains on its own 30-second
cadence. QUIC connects directly over UDP and does not use the Runner's HTTP
proxy settings.

### Outbound proxy for the Runner

If the Runner host needs an outbound HTTP proxy, set the proxy variables in
the Runner's service environment, not only in an interactive shell. WebSocket
honors `HTTPS_PROXY`/`https_proxy`, then `HTTP_PROXY`/`http_proxy`, then
`ALL_PROXY`/`all_proxy`; `NO_PROXY`/`no_proxy` bypasses matching hosts. The
supported proxy transport is `http://host:port` via HTTP `CONNECT`. QUIC does
not use proxy settings.

## Reconnect and recovery

A Runner disconnect is a liveness fact, not a lost-work fact. Accepted active
Jobs enter a bounded `recovering` state (default grace 120 seconds) and are
restored from the Runner's inventory when the same Runner instance reconnects.
Ordinary Jobs remain owned by that exact Runner process: a replacement instance
does not inherit their child processes, so they become `lost`. Explicit
`run_detached_process` Jobs are different: after a one-shot durable ownership
handoff, a narrow supervisor owns the payload tree. If that exact supervisor and
its fenced execution identity remain live, a replacement Runner can reconstruct
the same logical detached Job and route observation or stop through its durable
control state. This does not make ordinary process execution detachable, and it
does not promise survival across a machine reboot.

Completed caller-visible ordinary Jobs have a separate Server-owned SQLite
receipt. Within the original 15-minute terminal retention window, up to 64
receipts per logical Runner survive a coordinated Server/Runner restart and
remain available through `list_jobs`, `observe_jobs`, and bounded log reads.
Receipts preserve the Job id, terminal result, retained log cursors and tails,
and original authorization partition/owner; Runner registration is not required
to observe them. Restarts and receipt replay do not renew their deadlines.
Storage failure degrades restart observability without changing execution success.

These receipts are read-only evidence. They contain no command input, stdin,
environment, validation argv, replay intent, process handle, or execution lease.
Active ordinary Jobs remain process-owned; only `run_detached_process` has an
explicit durable execution ownership handoff. Hidden synchronous results and
detached ownership state are excluded from ordinary receipt persistence.

The Server distinguishes the stable Runner `client_id` from the current live process lease. A stale or replacement process cannot keep submitting results under the old lease, and ordinary child-process Jobs are not adopted by a replacement Runner. The exact lease identifier is an internal wire detail.

Reconnect happens automatically with a short delay. Authentication failure and
other fatal errors stop the Runner rather than looping forever.

## Shutting down and restarting

`webcodex-runner` stops cleanly on `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`. It does not daemonize
itself. For a supervised deployment, use `webcodex runner install --scope
user|system` to install and supervise it as a user or system service, and keep
the token in the service environment.

After a machine reboot, a hosted `connect` profile is restarted by rerunning
`webcodex connect` or `webcodex runner start --profile <profile>`. Automatic
startup at logon is not implemented for hosted profiles.

On Windows, each Runner process also writes one small bounded lifecycle record under
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\webcodex\runner-exit-diagnostics-v1\<runner-hash>\` (falling
back to `%USERPROFILE%\.local\state\webcodex` and then `%TEMP%\webcodex` through
the normal Runner state-path rules). Only the newest eight process records are
retained. A record contains the local PID, process start time, build identity,
transport, shutdown-signal observation, transport return class, and clean/fatal
terminal classification. A sibling `*.panic.json` file is written best-effort
when a Rust panic hook runs and contains only the thread name and source location;
it never stores the panic payload. These diagnostics never contain credentials,
commands, Job output, request payloads, or Server response bodies, and a state
write failure never changes Runner lifecycle behavior.

For an unexpected supervised exit, correlate the supervisor's PID/timestamp with
the matching lifecycle record. `terminal=null` means the process disappeared
before Rust recorded a clean/fatal return. A panic sibling narrows that to a Rust
panic; `shutdown_signal_received_at_unix_ms` without a terminal record points to
an interrupted graceful-shutdown path. If neither is present, investigate an
external/native process termination or supervisor action before adding broader
Runner telemetry.

## SSH session resources (advanced)

A Runner with an available local OpenSSH client advertises the `ssh_shell`
capability. A Workflow Session may select a named SSH resource so `run_shell`
and `run_job` execute on a remote host through the Runner's own OpenSSH client
on both Unix and Windows. Unix may reuse a Runner-local ControlMaster transport;
Windows starts one direct `ssh.exe` process per one-shot/background execution and
does not use `ControlMaster`, `ControlPersist`, or `-S`. The separate
`ssh_persistent_shell` capability allows the same resource to be used by
`open_session_shell`: Unix may reuse its mux, while Windows owns one direct
long-lived `ssh.exe` channel.

```toml
[ssh.resources.tmp]
host = "tmp"
default_cwd = "/opt/webcodex-edge"
```

The `host` value is passed to the Runner machine's OpenSSH client, so normal
`~/.ssh/config`, keys, `ssh-agent`, and `ProxyJump` configuration remain on
that machine. Do not put credentials, private keys, or complete SSH
configuration into session data, Server storage, or tool input. A Session's
`execution_context.resource` routes `run_shell`, `run_job`, and supported
`open_session_shell` calls through that resource; file, Git, and LSP tools
remain local. Configuration reloads bind future commands to the current resource
generation; already-started SSH commands keep their own bounded lifecycle and
are never redirected, replayed, or blindly retried.

Authorized model clients can also onboard Runner-local SSH resources with the
`ssh_resource` MCP tool. `list` returns only safe logical names plus
`static|managed`, active/pending-restart state, and an opaque exact-Runner /
registry-revision binding. `register` accepts one explicit OpenSSH destination
argv and optional default cwd; `remove` deletes only managed desired state.
Raw targets, usernames, addresses, SSH options, credentials, and identity paths
are never returned by the tool. Static `[ssh.resources.*]` names are reserved
and cannot be overwritten or removed through this path.

Managed mutations are durable desired-state changes, not live configuration
edits. When a mutation returns `restart_required=true`, restart that Runner,
then `list` again before binding the resource into a Workflow Session. An
idempotent operation already aligned with the frozen startup snapshot may
return `restart_required=false`. Access is separately gated by the optional
`ssh:local` permission; hosted OAuth clients opt in with
`webcodex connect ... --oauth-local-ssh`.

The managed target is still consumed by the existing SSH transport. In
particular, registering a Windows OpenSSH destination does not imply that
PersistentShell can start there: the current remote persistent-shell contract
requires the existing remote `sh`/`bash` path. Remote PowerShell PersistentShell
is not part of this capability.

## LSP navigation (read-only)

The Runner can serve read-only semantic navigation through language servers
run on the repository machine:

| Language | Server | Markers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rust | `rust-analyzer` | `Cargo.toml` |
| Go | `gopls` | `go.mod`, `go.work` |
| Python | `pyright` | `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `requirements.txt`, … |
| TypeScript / JavaScript | `typescript-language-server` | `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, … |
| Vue SFC | `vue-language-server` | `vue.config.js`, `vue.config.cjs`, `vue.config.mjs` |

The tools are `lsp_status`, `document_symbols`, `goto_definition`,
`find_references`, `document_diagnostics`, `hover`, and `workspace_symbols`.
The distinct `call_hierarchy` operation performs prepare plus bounded
incoming/outgoing breadth-first traversal inside the Runner. The canonical
Connector projects it as `code_impact`; raw protocol methods and opaque LSP
item data are never exposed.
They are read-only, project-bound, and constrained so that starting a language
server never executes repository code or fetches dependencies. Paths are
project-relative; external/dependency locations are omitted. Servers must be
installed on the Runner machine or pointed to by env overrides such as
`WEBCODEX_RUST_ANALYZER`, `WEBCODEX_VUE_LANGUAGE_SERVER`, and
`WEBCODEX_GOPLS`. Vue SFC navigation currently targets standalone
`@vue/language-server@2.2.12`; install it with TypeScript 5, or point
`WEBCODEX_VUE_TSDK` at a TypeScript `lib` directory. Without that override,
WebCodex uses `<project>/node_modules/typescript/lib`. The Vue profile forces
`vue.hybridMode=false`, disables the auto-import cache, and blocks outbound
HTTP/package traffic. Vue Language Server 3.x currently expects an editor-owned
`tsserver/request` bridge and is therefore not treated as a drop-in replacement
for this standard-LSP path. The gopls profile also forces module/toolchain
network access off and uses `-mod=readonly`; WebCodex never installs gopls or
fetches missing Go dependencies for semantic navigation.
The default per-project LSP process capacity is two so a Vue project can keep
its TypeScript/JavaScript server and Vue server alive together; the existing
per-Runner process bound remains four.

Call hierarchy requires the separately advertised `lsp_call_hierarchy`
capability and the selected server's `callHierarchyProvider`. Missing support
fails explicitly without grep, AST, shell, or reference fallback.

## Operating the Runner

Minimal commands:

```bash
webcodex runner status --profile <profile>
webcodex runner logs --profile <profile> --lines 100
webcodex runner restart --profile <profile>
```

For a user service:

```bash
webcodex runner install --scope user --config <login-reported-runner-config>
webcodex runner status --scope user --config <login-reported-runner-config>
```

For an administrator-managed system service:

```bash
sudo webcodex runner install --scope system --profile <profile> \
  --user <runner-user> --working-directory /home/<runner-user>
sudo webcodex runner status --scope system --profile <profile>
```

Use the same `--scope` for install, status, start, stop, restart, logs, and
uninstall. User scope uses `systemctl --user`; system scope uses
`/etc/systemd/system`.

For an already-running Runner, use the first-class configuration workflow instead
of finding its PID or sending signals manually:

1. Edit the Runner's existing startup-bound `runner.toml`.
2. Call `runner_config_check(client_id=...)`. It reads only that bound path, does
   not activate the candidate, and returns the current generation plus bounded
   validation/restart metadata.
3. If valid, call
   `runner_config_reload(client_id=..., expected_generation=<current_generation>)`.
   The optimistic generation fence rejects stale callers before activation.
4. Inspect `runtime_status(client_id=...)` (or `list_runners`) after reload.

`runner_config_reload` never writes `runner.toml`; it only activates the candidate
already on disk. Hot-reloadable policy, shell, configured Skill roots, configured
instruction files, Native Plugin, and static SSH-resource changes can become active
immediately, while fields reported in `restart_required_fields`
remain startup-only until the Runner restarts. Invalid candidates leave the active
snapshot and generation unchanged. Managed `ssh_resource` mutations are different:
they use a frozen startup snapshot and require a Runner restart exactly when the
tool reports `restart_required=true`.

Plugin configuration is live-applied through the same validated Plugin candidate
admission/commit primitive used by `plugin_tool reload`; changing `[plugins]` is
not a restart-only operation. `plugin_tool reload` remains the narrower
`plugin:manage`-scoped entry when only Plugin state should be reloaded.

On Unix, service reload/SIGHUP remains an optional compatibility trigger and calls
the same authoritative reload primitive. Windows and macOS use the first-class
operation directly; no signal emulation or PID management is required. When a
validation failure is safely classifiable, config operations report only closed
non-secret atoms such as `field=max_concurrent_jobs` and `reason=out_of_range`;
raw TOML, configured values, paths, credentials, parser text, and shell environment
values are not projected.
