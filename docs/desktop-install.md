# WebCodex Desktop: quick install and ChatGPT connection

[English](desktop-install.md) | [简体中文](desktop-install.zh-CN.md)

For normal Windows or macOS personal use, **WebCodex Desktop + the official OpenAI Secure Tunnel is the recommended path**. It keeps the Server and Runner local, gives ChatGPT a private Tunnel connection, and avoids making first-time users configure reverse proxies, OAuth, system services, or a public WebCodex endpoint.

The normal path is intentionally product-level; you do not need to understand the Runner registry, `runtime_project_id`, the internal MCP authorization file, or launchd internals:

```text
install Desktop
→ save the Tunnel ID and API key in Desktop
→ choose the real project ChatGPT should use
→ wait for Service / Runner / Project to become ready
→ start the official OpenAI Secure Tunnel
→ connect ChatGPT with the Tunnel ID
→ Desktop shows “Tunnel ready; waiting for ChatGPT”
→ perform one real project read from ChatGPT as final acceptance
```

**Important:** “OpenAI Secure Tunnel ready” proves only that the local Tunnel is ready **for** ChatGPT. It does **not** prove that ChatGPT has connected or that a project tool can already execute. The real project read in step 8 is the final proof. For CLI, an existing remote Server, production hosting, or advanced networking, use the [Full Setup](PERSONAL_SETUP.md) or [Deployment](DEPLOYMENT.md) guides instead.

For everyday use after installation, see [Using Desktop](desktop-guide.md). Home now centers the current project and three usage steps; component details live under “View runtime diagnostics”. OpenAI Platform screenshots below are configuration references; follow the current Desktop control names in the text.

## 1. Install WebCodex Desktop

Download the matching Desktop artifact from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/zhengweijun18/webcodex/releases) page:

- **Windows x64:** use `win32-x64-setup.exe`.
- **Windows ARM64:** use `win32-arm64-setup.exe`.
- **macOS:** use the DMG matching your Mac architecture, Intel or Apple Silicon.

Current macOS builds are ad-hoc signed and are not notarized. If Gatekeeper blocks the first launch of a newly downloaded build, open **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway**, then confirm **Open**. Do not disable Gatekeeper globally.

Launch WebCodex Desktop after installation.

**Success looks like:** the main WebCodex window opens without a missing package/runtime error.

**If it fails:** use **Open Anyway** for the Gatekeeper case above; if the packaged runtime is missing, reinstall the same Desktop version instead of manually assembling internal binaries.

**Next:** confirm the Tunnel configuration before starting a Tunnel.

### Background lifecycle and Launch at Login

WebCodex Desktop is a long-running local runtime controller. Closing the main window does **not** quit the application:

- On **macOS**, use the WebCodex menu-bar item to reopen the window.
- On **Windows**, use the WebCodex system-tray icon to reopen the window.
- The Desktop-owned local Server, Runner, regular OpenAI Secure Tunnel, and an active Quick Share session continue running while the window is hidden. Quick Share remains a temporary session; it is not converted into a permanent service by background residency.
- **Stop local runtime** is a desired-state action: it stops the local runtime and changes the saved runtime preference. It is different from hiding the window.
- **Quit WebCodex** is the application-exit action. Quit stops the Desktop-owned process tree before Desktop exits. It does not broadly terminate unrelated WebCodex processes that Desktop does not own.

In **Settings → Background & startup**, **Launch WebCodex at login** registers Desktop with the operating system and starts it in the background without opening the main window. This setting is separate from the saved runtime preferences: `runtime_autostart` still decides whether the saved local runtime is restored, and the saved connection preference still decides whether the regular ChatGPT Tunnel is restored when appropriate.

### Everyday controls

- Use the sidebar to open Home, Projects, Connection, Extensions, Activity, and Settings. Use **⌘ + 1–6** on macOS or **Ctrl + 1–6** on Windows. Navigation shortcuts also work inside inputs and language selectors; ordinary typing and text-editing shortcuts remain available.
- Home shows the current project, next action, and three usage steps. Expand **View runtime diagnostics** to inspect all four components.
- In **Activity**, search messages or sources, or select **Warnings and errors only**. Results are newest first. Filtering changes the view without deleting records.
- Use Tab to focus main buttons and Enter to activate them. Navigation moves focus into page content.

## 2. Prepare an OpenAI Tunnel

Create a Tunnel in the OpenAI Platform and prepare an API key that can use that Tunnel:

- [Tunnels - OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/tunnels)
- [API keys - OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys)

The Tunnel name is up to you. Record the Tunnel ID. A Restricted API key with only the Tunnel permissions you need is recommended.

![OpenAI Tunnels page](desktop-install/image-20260906171606559.png)

![OpenAI API Keys page](desktop-install/image-20260906171633208.png)

Do not commit or share real API keys, WebCodex tokens, or authorization values.

## 3. Save Tunnel configuration inside Desktop (recommended)

Open **Connection → Tunnel connection settings**. This editor stays visible while the regular Tunnel is running or stopped:

1. Enter your Tunnel ID in **Tunnel ID**.
2. Enter an API key authorized for that Tunnel in the **Tunnel API key** password field.
3. Click **Save configuration**. Once the source shows the local configuration file, you can start the connection. **No Desktop restart is required.**

The same fields are available in the optional Tunnel section during local setup. When a key is already saved, leaving its field blank keeps that key. Desktop never retrieves the secret into the UI; submission clears the input. A failed save retains the Tunnel ID but requires re-entering an unsaved key.

**Priority: complete saved configuration → inherited Desktop process environment.** Desktop never combines a saved Tunnel ID with an environment API key. Saving does not modify system variables. An active Desktop-owned regular Tunnel is replaced with the saved configuration, without restarting Server or Runner. A stopped Tunnel remains stopped. OpenAI Quick Share uses the new values on its next start. Save success and connection recovery are distinct: a replacement failure retains the new configuration and asks you to retry the connection.

The file is `secrets/tunnel-config.json` in Desktop's local application data directory:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/dev.webcodex.desktop/secrets/tunnel-config.json`.
- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\dev.webcodex.desktop\secrets\tunnel-config.json`.

This file contains an **unencrypted API key**. Keep it out of projects, Git, tickets, and shared backups. macOS/Unix writes are owner-only (`0600`); Windows inherits access permissions from the current user's local application data directory. Saves use atomic replacement without retaining old secret backups. The `secrets` directory is excluded by WebCodex’s existing sensitive-path policy. Ordinary `desktop-state.json` remains non-secret runtime state.

**Clear saved configuration and use environment** clears the saved pair and restores environment fallback; the file records `null`. Invalid or unreadable saved configuration does not fall back automatically. Repair it by saving again in the UI or explicitly clear it. Manual file edits require restarting Desktop; in-app saves do not.

### Optional: continue using environment variables

Without saved configuration, Desktop uses its inherited process environment:

```text
CONTROL_PLANE_TUNNEL_ID
CONTROL_PLANE_API_KEY
```

No additional `OPENAI_ADMIN_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` is needed. On first OpenAI Secure Tunnel use, WebCodex automatically downloads and verifies a pinned `tunnel-client`; manual installation is normally unnecessary. If download fails, check networking or proxies. Advanced users can set `WEBCODEX_TUNNEL_CLIENT_BIN`.

Windows users can set persistent variables for the current user. On macOS, Finder / Dock launches do not read `~/.zshrc`; launch from a Terminal that has loaded the variables or configure the login session environment. After changing variables through this advanced path, use **Quit WebCodex** in the tray and launch it again. Closing the window only hides it and cannot refresh its process environment. **Recheck configuration** neither executes shell startup scripts nor reloads manually edited configuration files.

### macOS Computer Use permissions

A first foreground launch with missing Desktop permissions opens an in-app explanation. Explicit request buttons use the native macOS permission APIs; **Continue** leaves permissions unchanged. Background/login launches do not steal focus. **Settings → Computer Use permissions** shows observed Desktop permissions and lets you recheck or open System Settings. It does not infer the actual Runner's authorization from Desktop's state.

For screenshots, window observation, keyboard or pointer control, grant the relevant permissions under **System Settings → Privacy & Security** to the process actually running WebCodex Runner/Desktop. These include **Screen & System Audio Recording**, and **Accessibility** for UI control. Restart the affected process when macOS requires it.

**Success looks like:** the source is the local file and both presence checks pass. Next, select the actual project ChatGPT should use.

## 4. Start the local runtime and add your project

On first use, choose **Local Full Runtime / Use WebCodex on this computer**, then select the **real repository directory you want ChatGPT to use**. Desktop prepares the local Service + Runner and makes the Runner load that exact project. Desktop's own default workspace is not a substitute for selecting your actual project.

Setup remains disabled until you select a project. If project setup or the optional Tunnel start fails, the setup page keeps your selection and shows the error so you can retry.

This is an intentional authority boundary: the default Desktop project does not grant access to unrelated directories or the whole disk.

For local pairing, Desktop derives a Server-compatible username from your OS username: names the Server already accepts are kept as-is; otherwise ASCII letters are lowercased, each run of unsupported characters becomes a single `-`, the name's own `-` characters are preserved, leading and trailing generated separators are removed, and the result is limited to 64 characters. Names with nothing left use `desktop`. This local pairing name is not an OS login identity; existing saved enrollment is reused on restart.

Home puts overall readiness and the next action first, with direct shortcuts to Projects, Connection, and Activity. After a local Full Runtime is configured, **Choose another project** or **Add project** on Projects opens the folder picker and applies the selected exact project immediately. The full setup flow is reserved for first use or changing runtime topology.

After setup, expand **View runtime diagnostics** on Home and confirm all three items:

- Service: Running / Ready;
- Runner: Connected / Ready;
- Project: Ready, with the path you actually selected.

If you see **Project not ready** / `project_not_loaded`, normal Desktop users do **not** need to inspect a project registry. Use the **Reload project** action in the error card. Desktop retries the same project and, when required, restarts only the Runner process it owns within a bounded readiness window.

When the runtime is already running and you choose another project, do not manually stop the runtime or OpenAI Secure Tunnel first. Desktop extends the Runner policy with the exact selected root, hot-activates it when the Runner supports config reload, persists the new current project after readiness, and keeps the existing local Service and Tunnel. Only a legacy or incompatible Desktop-owned Runner is replaced. A failed transition must not leave the old project falsely displayed as ready.

**Success looks like:** Service, Runner, and Project are all Ready, and the displayed project path is exact.

**If it fails:** use **Reload project**, then inspect Activity/error details if it still fails. Do not broaden allowed roots or substitute a different Runner to bypass project authority.

**Next:** start the OpenAI Secure Tunnel only after these three are ready.

## 5. Configure Tunnel networking if needed

Open **Settings → OpenAI Tunnel network**:

- **Automatic (recommended):** use the proxy inherited by Desktop; Windows can also detect the system proxy.
- **Direct:** do not use a proxy.
- **Custom HTTP proxy:** for example `http://127.0.0.1:7890`.

If the Tunnel is already running, stop it, save the new network setting, and start it again. You do **not** need to restart Desktop; each Tunnel start reads the current setting.

**Success looks like:** the network mode saves successfully. If you do not need special proxy handling, leave **Automatic (recommended)** selected.

**If it fails:** fix Tunnel networking here; do not change project authority or Runner configuration to work around a network error.

**Next:** start the OpenAI Secure Tunnel.

## 6. Start the official OpenAI Secure Tunnel

Open **Connection**, select **OpenAI Secure Tunnel**, then click **Start secure tunnel**. Selection alone does not start or stop processes. If an existing tunnel reports an error, stop it before starting again; failures remain visible with a retry path. When local handoff is ready, Desktop should show wording such as:

> OpenAI Secure Tunnel ready; waiting for ChatGPT

Desktop copies the Tunnel ID to the clipboard when the operating system allows it.

Desktop must **not** promote daemon readiness or a successful clipboard copy to “ChatGPT connected” or “Ready to use”. Those facts prove only that the Tunnel is **ready for ChatGPT**.

**Success looks like:** the Tunnel itself is locally ready while the overall presentation still makes clear that ChatGPT connection/final verification is pending.

**If it fails:** first confirm that both configuration-presence fields from step 3 are Detected, then check the proxy mode in step 5 and use the on-screen Tunnel recovery action.

**Next:** enter the Tunnel ID in ChatGPT.

## 7. Add WebCodex to ChatGPT

When creating the custom connection/app in ChatGPT:

1. Choose **Tunnel** as the connection method.
2. Enter the Tunnel ID from Desktop/OpenAI.
3. Set **Authentication** to **None / No authentication**.

You do not configure OAuth in ChatGPT for this path. WebCodex keeps the MCP authorization credential locally and the Tunnel client injects it; ChatGPT does not need the local credential.

After saving the ChatGPT connection, return to Desktop. Saving a connection in ChatGPT does not magically upgrade local Tunnel evidence into an authoritative “connected” signal. If this Desktop version has no stable external-MCP-client observation signal, it intentionally continues to say that it is waiting for ChatGPT.

**Success looks like:** the ChatGPT connection is saved and the Desktop Tunnel remains running.

**If it fails:** verify that you entered the Tunnel ID, not the API key; Authentication should be None / No authentication. Do not paste the Tunnel API key into ChatGPT.

**Next:** immediately perform one real project read.

## 8. Minimal acceptance check

After connecting, start with **one minimal real project read**, for example: “List the WebCodex projects, then list the top-level files in the project I just selected; report an empty directory as empty.” Only this proves the full path is actually working:

- list the WebCodex projects;
- read a file from the project you explicitly added;
- create, read back, and remove one temporary file inside that project;
- run a read-only command such as `git status`, `uname -a`, or `ver`;
- if you enabled Computer Use, list windows or capture a browser window.

If these work, the Tunnel, Server, Runner, project authority, and ordinary tool path are connected correctly.

If Desktop shows a healthy Service / Runner / Project / Tunnel but ChatGPT still cannot list projects or read a file, do **not** treat local green status as proof of an external connection. Recheck the Tunnel ID and ChatGPT connection configuration, then inspect Desktop Connection / Activity for the latest state.

## Troubleshooting

**OpenAI Secure Tunnel is disabled:** save a complete Tunnel ID and API key in Desktop, then check that the local runtime is ready. If using environment fallback, fully quit and reopen after changing variables.

**macOS Terminal sees the values but Desktop does not:** Finder/Dock apps do not load `~/.zshrc`; use the Terminal-launch or `launchctl setenv` path above. Desktop Recheck does not execute shell startup scripts.

**Tunnel startup or ChatGPT connection times out:** check **Settings → OpenAI Tunnel network** first, then stop and restart the Tunnel after changing the proxy mode.

**A repository is not accessible:** add that directory explicitly on the **Projects** page instead of broadening the default Desktop project's filesystem authority.

**You see `project_not_loaded` / Project not ready:** use **Reload project**. Desktop retries the same project and manages only its own Runner; normal users do not need to edit or understand the internal project registry.

**I closed the window and reopened it, but new environment variables are still missing:** since the background-lifecycle change, closing the window hides Desktop in the tray/menu bar. Use **Quit WebCodex** there, then start a new process.
